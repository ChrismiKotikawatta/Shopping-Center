VIDEO â€“ (5 marks for the quality of your video)

You are requested to record a video of the system you implemented.
You need to run the project and show all the functionalities you implemented in the console menu and in the GUI.
Add at least 5 products during the demonstration.
You should also record your voice explaining what you are demonstrating.

Note that if the video is not submitted, your mark will be capped to 30%.


*** I think you need to record the video, convert it to a .mp4 and upload it in youtube as an unlisted video.
    That link should be sent.
